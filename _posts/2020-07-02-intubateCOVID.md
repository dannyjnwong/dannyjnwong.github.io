I was a co-investigator for the [intubateCOVID project](https://www.intubatecovid.org/info), a user-reported registry of COVID-19 intubations and subsequent COVID-19 related outcomes in healthcare workers worldwide.

The incidence of COVID-19 in healthcare workers is thought to be higher than the general population. This incidence may be higher in healthcare workers who have been exposed to high viral loads while undertaking aerosol-generating procedures, such as tracheal intubation. There was previously no large-scale data on the association between airway management and the development of COVID-19. Our aims for the registry were:

1.  To ascertain the incidence of airway managers and assistants who develop COVID-19 in the weeks following an airway management episode.
2.  To document associations of risk factors with COVID-19.
3.  To examine the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) during airway management of COVID-19 patients. 
4.  To allow healthcare professionals to track their airway management activity
5.  To assess the demographic of airway managers.
6. To allow local, national and international reporting of airway management activity and provide information to support policymakers.

We have thus far received data from over 2000 users working at over 600 hospitals in 30 countries:
